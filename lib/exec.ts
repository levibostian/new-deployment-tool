/*
Executes a command and returns the exit code and the stdout of the command.

The entire command is passed in as 1 string. This is for convenience but also because when used as a github action, the commands will be passed to the tool as a single string.
Then, the command is split into the command and the arguments. This is required by Deno.Command.
You cannot simply split the string by spaces to create the args list. Example, if you're given: `python3 -c "import os; print(os.getenv('INPUT'))"` we expect only 2 args: "-c" and "import ...". 
We use a popular package to parse the string into the correct args list. See automated tests to verify that this works as expected. 

To make this function testable, we not only have the stdout and stderr be piped to the console, but we return it from this function so tests can verify the output of the command.

  // One common way would be to ask the subprocess to stdout a JSON string that we simply read, but this tool tries to promote stdout
