/**
 * Run the deployment commands that the user has provided in the github action workflow yaml file.
 *
 * This is the opportunity for the user to run any commands they need to deploy their project.
 * The main parts of this step:
 * 1. Run the commands the user has provided. Exit early if any fail.
 * 2. Provide data to the command and parse data that the command sends back to us.
 * 3. Add any files that the user has specified to git. We add and create a commit for them.
 * User may need to modify metadata of their project before deploying. Creating a git commit may be required to do that.
 * The tool performs all of the git operations (add, commit, push) for the user. Why?...
 * 1. The tool needs to have control over the git commit created so it can create the git tag pointing to that commit.
 * 2. Convenience for the user. No need for them to run all of these commands themselves. Including setting the author. They may forget something.
 * 3. If the user is running multiple commands for deployment, there is a chance that multiple commands create commits. That just makes this tool more complex.
